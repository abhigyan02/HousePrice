House price detection algorithm
The code implements linear regression to analyze the relationship between house size (in square feet) and house prices (in dollars).

It uses the scikit-learn library in Python to perform linear regression, calculate the mean squared error (MSE), and determine the R-squared value. The dataset, 'house_prices.csv,' is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and the data is then converted into arrays for the machine learning model. The code visualizes the dataset and the fitted regression line using Matplotlib. Finally, it demonstrates making a prediction using the trained model.
